## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The University of Natural Resources and Environment of PNG (UNRE) seeks to implement a comprehensive digital financial management system to automate and streamline the General Expenditure (GE) request and approval process. This initiative aims to replace the current manual, paper-based system with a modern, web-based solution that provides real-time budget visibility, automated workflows, and complete audit trails.

**Project Value**: PGK 250,000 (estimated)
**Expected ROI**: 300% over 3 years through efficiency gains
**Primary Beneficiaries**: 500+ university staff, 15 departments, Finance & Audit teams
**Strategic Alignment**: UNRE Digital Transformation Strategy 2025-2030

## 1. PROJECT BACKGROUND

### 1.1 Current Situation

The University of Natural Resources and Environment of PNG currently manages General Expenditure requests through a manual, paper-based system that involves:

- Physical GE forms filled by staff
- Manual routing to multiple approvers (HOD → Dean → Bursar → Registrar → VC)
- Paper-based filing and storage
- Manual budget checking against PGAS (Provincial Government Accounting System)
- Limited real-time budget visibility
- Time-consuming approval processes (average 15-30 days)
- Difficulty tracking request status
- Incomplete audit trails
- Risk of lost documents
- Manual consolidation for reporting

### 1.2 Problem Statement

The current manual system presents several critical challenges:

**Operational Inefficiencies:**
- Average 15-30 days for request approval
- Manual data entry leads to errors
- Lost or misplaced documents
- Difficulty tracking request status
- Time-consuming budget verification

**Financial Control Issues:**
- No real-time budget visibility
- Budget overruns not detected until month-end
- Difficult to track commitments
- Limited spending analysis
- Manual reconciliation with PGAS

**Compliance Risks:**
